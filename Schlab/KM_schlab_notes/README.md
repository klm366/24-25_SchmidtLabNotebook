# Kelly's Handwritten Notes

## Organized into:

1.  Mostly unhelpful notes on Unix and R that I took at the very beginning of my internship

2.  Notes on the microbial loop -mostly based on "The microbial loop" (Pomeroy et al., 2007)

3.  Miscellaneous notes on microbiology concepts that have come up but are not directly related to what I have been doing thus far

4.  Notes related to my project on the impact of oyster farming on marine sediment microbial communities
