## Kelly Miller's Lab Notebook (2025 New Visions high school intern)

#### What I've been up to:
1. **In KM_oystersLitReview -** My project is a continuation of Evelyn and Gabriela's work studying oyster microbiota from various sampling sites along the Massachusetts coast. The literature review is on the impact of oyster aquaculture on sediment microbial communities and the role those microbes play in biogeochemical cycling (ex. facilitating increased denitrification compared to the control).
2. **In KM_schlab_notes -** All of the notes I have taken on papers and lectures.
3. **In carpentries_workshop_feedback_MillerK_2025 -** In January, I proof-read Gus' Lake Ontario-based coding curriculum and was a helper at the workshop (1/14-1/15).
