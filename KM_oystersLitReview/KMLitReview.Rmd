# Introduction to the microbial world

In a narrative that usually centers around plants, microorganisms are the unsung heroes of primary production. They work on a scale we cannot see, but the effects of their cumulative efforts are impossible to miss. Half of the oxygen in each breath we take has been produced by oceanic microbes [@pomeroy]. But who learned that in high school Biology?

Let's start by meeting the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. In the classification system (domain, kingdom, phylum..., species), domain is the broadest level of distinction. As humans, we belong to the domain Eukarya, along with all other organisms whose cell(s) have genetic material enclosed in membrane-bound nuclei. In other words, in the most basic deliniation between all life forms present on Earth, we, in all of our complexity, are grouped with plants, fungi, and many microbial species (including some single-celled microbes), while the two remaining categories are not only exclusively microbes, but exclusively prokaryotic[^1] microbes.

[^1]: Prokaryotes: Unicellular microbes with free-floating genetic material in their cytoplasm. They can have organelles, like ribosomes (which all organisms have) or flagella (little extracellular hairlike-structures that enable movement for cells), but they do not have membrane-bound organelles. A prokaryotic cell is like DNA/RNA-cytoplasm soup.

Instead of performing metabolic pathways from start to finish, like how food is passed from mouth to esophagus to stomach to small intestine, etc., in our digestive systems, microorganisms are reliant on each other to achieve comparable biological processes. Take a look at the denitrification step of the nitrogen cycle, which–among other applications–is facilitated by microbial communities in the marine sediments associated with oyster farms: nitrate (NO~3~^-^) is converted by \_\_ to nitrite (NO~2~^-^)\_\_\_ which is converted nitric oxide (NO) by \_\_\_\_ and then to nitrous oxide (N~2~O) by \_\_\_\_\_ and finally to dinitrogen (N~2~) by \_\_\_\_\_\_. Each microorganism in this pathway has a unique enzyme that catalyzes one particular reaction in the sequence, with the collective result being denitrification.[^2] Dr. Lawrence Pomeroy describes these community behaviors as "external digestive processes [which] provide shared benefits for motile bacteria" [@pomeroy]. Dr. Farooq Azam simplifies this further, calling microbial communities the "ultimate swimming stomachs" [@pomeroy].

[^2]: More on this later. Denitrification is an important aspect of the role that sediment microbes in oyster beds play as water purifiers.

When we talk about the factors at play regulating ecological systems, when we talk about the cycling of nutrients between earth, water, sky, and us, it does us well to acknowledge that the drivers of biological processes are microorganisms. It's a microbial world; we're just living in it.

# Introduction to oyster farming

Oyster aquaculture on the eastern seaboard has risen (?) in the last several decades, after centuries of declining natural populations from over-harvesting (fact check?). While we face the deleterious ecological impacts of current industrial and agricultural production methods, oyster farming has been proposed as part of a re-imagined, more sustainable food system. Not only does oyster cultivation bypass certain agricultural issues like land scarcity; common scientific thought has it that farming oysters can provide benefits to the health of the ecosystem. These potential benefits include enhanced water quality, habitat provision to other marine species, and storm surge protection [@stevens2024].

While oysters do pull algae and larger plankton[^3] (macroplankton) from the water column, this is not the extent of their ability to improve water quality. The real magic makers live in oyster poop.

[^3]: microorganisms that are not motile; they move with the currents

are filter-feeders. They suck water through their gills, filtering out larger (?) plankton and algae while seawater passes through.

Oyster aquaculture has been practiced globally since ancient civilizations–the likes of Greece, Rome, and the Han Dynasty [@botta2020]. [quote about oyster abundance in the Hudson Bay in the 1800s?] While we face the deleterious ecological impacts of current industrial and agricultural production methods, oyster farming has been proposed as part of a re-imagined, more sustainable food system. Not only does oyster cultivation bypass certain agricultural issues like land scarcity; common scientific thought has it that farming oysters can provide benefits to the health of the ecosystem. These potential benefits include enhanced water quality, habitat provision to other marine species, and storm surge protection [@stevens2024].

benefits: promote biogeochemical cycling, storm surge protection

# Theory #1: Oysters enhance the biodiversity and composition of microbial communities in the seafloor.

# Theory #2: Oysters stimulate increased denitrification by sediment microbiota.

## Summary of Ray & Fulweiler paper, "Meta-analysis of oyster impacts on coastal biogeochemistry"

Oyster aquaculture increases the cycling of nitrogen in marine systems by stimulating denitrifying bacteria and archaea.This improves water quality, with the trade-off of releasing a small amount of nitrous oxide (N~2~o) into the atmosphere [@ray2021].
