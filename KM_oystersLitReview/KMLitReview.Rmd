# Introduction to the microbial world

Walking into the Schmidt Aquatic Microbiology Lab at Cornell University, I had an idea of how nutrients flowed through ecosystems; I knew it all began with plants performing photosynthesis to turn sunlight energy into sugars for use by their own metabolisms or those of organisms higher in the food chain.

As it turns out, autotrophic plant production is not the whole story. Let's zoom out from the macroscopic world for a moment to meet the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. As humans, we belong to the domain Eukarya, which contains all life forms whose cell(s) have membrane-bound nuclei.

In each breath we breathe, about one half of the oxygen has been produced by oceanic microbes[@pomeroy]. It proves challenging to comprehend the sheer abundance of microorganisms that must be . For perspective, the number of stars in the universe is estimated to be 10\^21, while the number of bacteria in the ocean is

Microbial communities are

In a microbial community, many individual organisms are performing one function

Let's zoom out from the macroscopic world for a moment to meet the three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. As humans, we belong to the domain Eukarya, which contains all life forms whose cell(s) have membrane-bound nuclei. As in, not only are all multicellular organisms Eukarya, but so are some single-celled organisms. In contrast, all archaeans and bacteria are single

In other words, not only do all of the life forms recognizable to our eyes make up only a humble fraction of the living community on Earth; most of life exists as single cells that each perform In each breath we breathe, about one half of the oxygen has been produced by oceanic bacteria [@pomeroy]. (Thanks bacteria!) [The human hand and chemical fertilizers are not growing our food; microbes are, albeit with the optimization of good land husbandry practices.]

So when we talk about the factors at play regulating ecological systems, when we talk about the cycling of nutrients between earth, water, and sky, it does us well to acknowledge that the drivers of biological processes are microorganisms. It's a microbial world; we're just living in it.

# Introduction to oyster farming

Oyster aquaculture has been practiced globally since ancient civilizationsâ€“the likes of Greece, Rome, and the Han Dynasty [@botta2020]. [quote about oyster abundance in the Hudson Bay in the 1800s?] While we face the deleterious ecological impacts of current industrial and agricultural production methods, oyster farming has been proposed as part of a re-imagined, more sustainable food system. Not only does oyster cultivation bypass certain agricultural issues like land scarcity; common scientific thought has it that farming oysters can provide benefits to the health of the ecosystem. These potential benefits include enhanced water quality, habitat provision to other marine species, and storm surge protection [@stevens2024].

benefits: promote biogeochemical cycling, storm surge protection

# Theory #1: Oysters enhance the biodiversity and composition of microbial communities in the seafloor.

# Theory #2: Oysters stimulate increased denitrification by sediment microbiota.

## Summary of Ray & Fulweiler paper, "Meta-analysis of oyster impacts on coastal biogeochemistry"

Oyster aquaculture increases the cycling of nitrogen in marine systems by stimulating denitrifying bacteria and archaea.This improves water quality, with the trade-off of releasing a small amount of nitrous oxide (N~2~o) into the atmosphere [@ray2021].
